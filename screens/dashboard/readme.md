This Dashboard requires Internet to be able to connect to the Category5 API. Plus, it uses some web assets like fonts.

A web server is not needed: Just run it by opening index.html in a browser.

Functional Items:
- Category5 API will show whether we are currently on/off the air.
- Clock uses system clock and displays hours, minutes and seconds.
- Countdown to top of next minute.
- Spectrum analyzer will show ambient noise if you have a mic connected (and are using a browser that supports it).

The rest is all just eye candy at this point.

Probably works better in Chromium-based browsers. Firefox doesn't support some of the media stuff.
